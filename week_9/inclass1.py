#Exam opens on Wednesday

#REVIEW:

# Bianary Trees and Binary Search Trees:
#     Binary Search tree = left child is less than the right tree
#     Binary Tree = has two children
    
# Order of Complexity:
#     Find, Insert, and Delete: Log(n)
    
#     order n : searh through each itteration
#     order log()n : Log n dividing the space by two each time to find it fast
    
#     Log in this class is log2(n)
    
# In fix notation is how we normally write out math
# Post Fix : reverse polish notation
# Pre Fix

# Pre-order : do operation, go left, go right: Write a function that does a pre order traversal : Prints the root first
# in order operation: go left, do operation, go right.
# Post Order : go left, go right, do opertaion : Prints the root last

# Find function:
#     if root == value you want
#     return root
    
# pop() takes off the last thing pop(0) takes off the first
